# Applied-Data-Science-with-Python
Coursera course by University of Michigan

The 5 courses in this University of Michigan specialization
introduce learners to data science through the python
programming language. This skills-based specialization is
intended for learners who have a basic python or programming
background, and want to apply statistical, machine learning,
information visualization, and text analysis techniques to gain new
insight into their data. In the final course, students will work on
real-world data analysis projects, building a portfolio which
showcases their work while at the same time helping real clients
gain a better understanding of their data.
